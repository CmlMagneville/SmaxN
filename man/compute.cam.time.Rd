\title{Compute frames on which SmaxN has to be computed}
\usage{
compute.cam.time(dist_df, fish_speed)
}
\arguments{
\item{dist_df}{a numerical dataframe containing the distance between each 
pair of camera. There are as many rows as there are cameras and there are
as many columns as there are cameras, thus the dataframe is symmetrical
and the diagonal is filled with 0. \strong{Rows names and columns names
must be cameras names}.}

\item{fish_speed}{a numerical value refering to the maximal speed of the 
studied species. \strong{Speed must be given in meters per second}.}
}
\value{
the function returns a dataframe containing the minimal time 
 needed for an individual of the studied species to go from a camera to 
 another camera.There are as many rows as there are cameras and there are
 as many columns as there are cameras, thus the dataframe is symmetrical
 and the diagonal is filled with 0.
}
\description{
This function computes a dataframe containing the minimal time 
needed for an individual of the studied species to go from a camera to 
another camera. It is based on the distance between each pair of cameras 
and the swim speed of the species.
}
\examples{
 # Build distance dataframe for the example:
 dist_df_ex <- data.frame("A" = c(0, 2, 5, 5), "B" = c(2, 0, 5, 5), 
 "C" = c(5, 5, 0, 4), "D" = c(5, 5, 4, 0))
 rownames(dist_df_ex) <- c("A", "B", "C", "D")
 
 # Run the function:
 compute.cam.time(dist_df = dist_df_ex, fish_speed = 1.6)
 
}
